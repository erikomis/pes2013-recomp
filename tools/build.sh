# The one way to compile this port, for people and for agents working side by
# side. Ported from ../deadpool-recomp/tools/build.sh: each lifted chunk is tens
# of MB of C++ and clang takes 3-4 GB on a chunk; uncontrolled builds
# kernel-panicked this 24 GB Mac twice on 2026-11-01.
#
#   tools/build.sh           build, one at a time, watching disk and memory
#   tools/build.sh --check   only say what would be rebuilt
#
#   BUILD_OWNER=name         shown to whoever finds the lock (default: $USER)
#   BUILD_JOBS=n             parallel compiles (default 2)
#   BUILD_ALLOW_FULL=1       allow rebuilding more than MAX_CHUNKS lifted chunks
#
# Exit codes: 0 built, 1 build failed, 2 refused (nothing was started),
# 99 stopped by the memory guard.
